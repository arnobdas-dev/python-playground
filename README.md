## Overview
This repository serves as a **personal learning hub** for Python programming. It contains organized notes, hands-on exercises, and experimental projects to help build a solid foundation in Python and its applications across different domains.

---

## Learning Goals
- Master **Python fundamentals** (variables, loops, OOP, data structures)
- Explore **Machine Learning** algorithms and practical implementations
- Experiment with **AI** concepts (neural networks, neural computation)
- Build **Web Development** projects using Flask and Django
- Understand **Blockchain** concepts and Python-based experiments
- Learn **Networking** basics and Python socket programming
- Gain proficiency in **Data Analysis** using Pandas, NumPy, and visualization tools
